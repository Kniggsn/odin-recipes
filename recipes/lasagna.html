    <h2>What is Lasagna?</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't love <strong>lasagna?!</strong></p>
    <p>Lasagna, also known as <em>lasagne</em>,
        is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also
        refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats
        and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan),
        and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking.
        Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked
        pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
    <p>The following recipe represents the classic lasagna with bolognese as well as béchamel sauce, topped with cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients for 4 servings</h2>
    <h3>For the bolognese sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 dinner spoons olive oil</li>
        <li>500 g minced meat</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 bunch parsley</li>
        <li>1 dinner spoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>800 g peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>some red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the bèchamel sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>0.5 l milk</li>
        <li>30 g butter</li>
        <li>40 g flour</li>
        <li>some salt and pepper</li>
        <li>some lemon juice</li>
        <li>some nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Also:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>at will: grated cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation of the lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Ragú Bolognese:</h3>
            <p>Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, brown the minced meat in it all around and add the chopped onions and
                chopped parsley. Add the finely sliced garlic and tomato paste and fry. Add the canned tomatoes, salt
                and pepper. Add red wine to taste. Let the ragú boil down for at least half an hour with the pot
                open.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Béchamel sauce:</h3>
            <p>Melt the butter in a small saucepan and whisk in the flour and sweat until light yellow. Pour in the milk
                and stir the sauce until smooth. If you stirred too slowly and find lumps in the sauce, you can strain
                the sauce through a fine hair sieve and then let it continue cooking. The sauce should simmer on low for
                almost half an hour to lose the flour taste. Season to taste with salt, pepper, lemon juice and a little
                nutmeg.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Final preparation of the lasagna</h3>
            <p>In a buttered ovenproof dish, spread some ragú Bolognese, put a layer of lasagna sheets on top, cover the
                pasta layer again with ragú and then with a layer of bechamel.
                Then again a layer of pasta, ragú and bechamel. Fill the mold like this, layer by layer.
                The last layer should be the bechamel sauce. Sprinkle thickly with grated cheese and put butter flakes
                on top.</p>
            <p>Bake the lasagna in a hot oven at 180 °C convection oven for about 30 - 40 minutes until the crust is golden brown.</p>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong>You can also prepare the lasagna a day in advance and let it sit in the refrigerator.</p>
