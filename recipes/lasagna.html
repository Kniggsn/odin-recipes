    <h2>What is Lasagna?</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't love <strong>lasagna?!</strong></p>
    <p>Lasagna, also known as <em>lasagne</em>,
        is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also
        refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats
        and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan),
        and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking.
        Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked
        pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
    <p>The following recipe represents the classic lasagna with bolognese as well as béchamel sauce, topped with cheese.
