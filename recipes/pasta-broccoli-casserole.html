    <h2>Casseroles</h2>
    <p>Baked dishes have existed for thousands of years. Early casserole recipes consisted of rice that was pounded,
        pressed, and filled with a savoury mixture of meats such as chicken or sweetbread. Sometime around the 1870's
        this sense of casserole seems to have taken its current sense. Cooking in earthenware containers has always
        been common in most cultures, but the idea of casserole cooking as a one-dish meal became popular in the United
        States in the twentieth century, especially in the 1950's when new forms of lightweight metal and glass cookware
        appeared on the market. By the 1970's casseroles took on a less-than-sophisticated image.</p>
    <p>Our broccoli pasta casserole with ham goes in the oven in just 25 minutes. Topped with cream sauce and cheese, it's so deliciously creamy and crunchy. The whole family will enjoy it!
