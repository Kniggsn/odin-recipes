    <h2>Pasta Carbonara</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese, cured
        pork and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th
        century.

        The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two. Spaghetti is the
        most common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used. Normally guanciale or pancetta
        are used for the meat component, but lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.</p>
    <p>For decadent, creamy carbonara with lots of Parmesan, crispy fried bacon and a hint of nutmeg, you only need 6
        ingredients and 20 minutes.
