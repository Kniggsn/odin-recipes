# odin-recipes
A simple recipe website

My first little webpage.
The project is a collection of recipes.
On the homepage the available recipes are linked.
The respective recipe pages contain - implemented so far exclusively with HTML - a picture of the dish, a short description, the necessary ingredients and the preparation steps.
The following basic HTML principles are applied:
- Linking
- headings
- Bold and italic words
- ordered and unordered lists
- insertion of images
